#The Bootplate Theme

* Author: Ben Grunfeld (@bengunfeld)
* Creation Date: 6/3/2013


##Theme Description

This is the Bootplate (Twitter Bootstrap + HTML5 Boilerplate) theme, put together by Ben Grunfeld (@bengrunfeld). 

The idea of the project was simple â€“ to create a theme that was blanker than Roots, more responsive than Starkers, and which was based on a combination of Twitter Bootstrap and the HTML5 Boilerplate.

While there is minimal structure and styling to illustrate how responsive design is implemented, the code has been engineered to be removed quickly, leaving only the barest bones of a workable Wordpress theme.

##Personal Note

It is my hope that developers find this theme helpful, and that it makes the job of setting up a permutable responsive wordpress theme easier. If you appreicate it, please Star the project on GitHub, and leave a comment at the project's Google Group (https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/the-bootplate-wordpress-theme).
